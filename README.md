# StarDust -> Phase 4 AstroPI ![AstroPI + ESA](https://github.com/DavidGhergut/StarDust_AstroPI/blob/master/Esa_AstroPI.jpg "Sugestive Image")

## Purpose of the program written

#### The python code inside the ```main.py``` file helped us make several calculations that made the process of making the report easier.

## Method of obtaining the desired data

#### In order to generate the wanted output, we edited the csv given in Phase 3 (```imported_data.csv```) by deleting all the columns except those of most interest: temperature, humidity, pressure and CPU temperature.

##### Then, we focused on three main results:
#### 1️⃣ A new csv file that contains the temperature uninfluenced by the CPU (```resulted_data.csv```)
#### 2️⃣ Printing the average value for each data type / column
#### 3️⃣ Printing the min-max interval for each column, so that we how many and which plants will be able to live under these conditions
